    "We have calculated the occupancy rate depending upon availability of the property for renting. But in real there could be so many exogenous factors affecting occupancy rate. This leads to the disparity. So for the purpose of this analysis and visualizations, we'll use the given common occupancy rate of 75%."

    "2. As given in the assumptions that cost today will be same after 100 years, which might not be practially possible in the future, so we can built a forecasting model to predict increase or decrease in the cost as we have significant amount of data.\n",

    "3. We can use other socio economic variables like GDP, population and some of the weather variables to calculate occupancy rate of the properties.\n",
