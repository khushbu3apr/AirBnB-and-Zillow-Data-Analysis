The zipcodes like 11434, 10303, 10306 have highest return on cost because the purchasing cost is lower than other zipcodes. These properties are located in Queens and Staten Island. The zipcodes like 10013, 10014, 10011 have low return on cost because the expected revenue and purchasing cost both are high than other zipcodes.

This is because they have low purchasing cost of property and also occupancy rate is considered as 75%. Although, the revenue generated from zipcodes 10011, 10013, 10014 etc is very high , but the breakeven period is also very high because they have high purchasing cost. These zipcodes are located in Manhattan neighbourhood. Looking at the breakeven period, we can say that these zipcodes would not generate more profit. "

    "## Recommendations: \n",
    "##### Based on the above analysis, we recommend our solutions to real estate company as follows-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Zipcode 10036 in Manhattan neighbourhood has high expected revenue and high return on cost. This makes it the best zipcode to purchase 2 bedroom properties as it will break even soonest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Zipcode 10025 in Manhattan is also close to 10036. The expected revenue is among the middle of the 23 unique zipcodes. But it has the least average purchase cost for 2 bedroom properties and has a decent return on cost which makes it the second best zipcode to invest in.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Zipcode 10022 in Manhattan is another good deal to purchase 2 bedroom properties. It has high expected revenue with decent return on cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Zipcode 11215 in Brooklyn is also a very good location to purchase 2 bedroom properties. It is one of the cheapest options. Even though the average revenue is not as high as some of the other zipcodes have, the cheap purchase cost suffies the disadvantage of earning less expected revenue and makes it a great location for investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Zipcode 11231 in Brooklyn is close to zipcode 11215 as the average cost and the average expected revenue per year obtained from a property are close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### So these zipcodes will be considered on level one for profitable investing\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Zipcodes 10303, 10304, 10306, 11434 are the properties which have faster breakeven period and would start giving profits to the company soonest. As these properties are located in Staten Island and Queens where purchasing cost is less, justifies the low risk investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### So these zipcodes will be considered on level two for profitable investing\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Zipcodes 10013, 10128, 10003, 10028, 10014 would make for bad investment as their purchasing cost is high compared to return on cost. This would be profitable in long term because they have long breakeven periods, but we are asked for short term. \n",

    "## Future Steps to deliver a better product to real estate company:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can perform sentimental analysis for reviews, as there are so many variables given in the AirBnB data by creating a dictonary of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. As given in the assumptions that cost today will be same after 100 years, which might not be practially possible in the future, so we can built a forecasting model to predict increase or decrease in the cost as we have significant amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We can use other socio economic variables like GDP, population and some of the weather variables to calculate occupancy rate of the properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Breakeven period can be calculated for long and short stays.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The square footage of each property could be taken into account while calculating the cost and revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Further research can be done on to derive which factors impact bookings via AirBnb and by what weightage do they and hence a weighted model could be developed to get exact overall rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Model for occupancy could be developed based on preference of zipcode locations."
